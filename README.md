# Module-13

The US Geological Survey (USGS) is in charge of providing scientific data about natural hazards, resource availability, ecosystem health, and impacts of climate and land-use change. USGS scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. One of such resources is their USGS GeoJSON Feed, which provides comprehensive data sets related to geological hazards and phenomena. This feed contains the historic earthquake data, which can be a useful tool to map earthquake locations and major earthquakes. This project aims to showc global earthquake data from the last seven days in a world map and also display major earthquakes which are over the richter scale of 4.
